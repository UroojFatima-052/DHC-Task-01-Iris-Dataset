## Iris Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project contains a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset using Python.
The goal is to practice and demonstrate fundamental data-analysis skills including data loading, inspection, summarization, and visualization.

### Tasks Performed
1. Load the Dataset

Imported the Iris dataset using pandas / seaborn

Inspected dataset structure using:

.shape
.columns
.head()
.describe()

2. Data Visualization

Created visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn:

a. Scatter Plot

Visualized relationships between variables (e.g., sepal length vs sepal width).

b. Histograms

Plotted distributions of numerical features to understand spread and shape.

c. Box Plots

Identified outliers and compared feature ranges across species.

### Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn
